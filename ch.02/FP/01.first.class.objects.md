# First-class objects
In JavaScript, functions are `first-class objects`, which means they can be assigned to variables and passed as parameters to other functions. 

This allows us to introduce the concept of `Higher-order Functions (HoF)`. HoFs are functions that `take a function` as `parameter`, optionally some other parameters, and `return a function`. 

the returned function is usually enhanced some special behaviours.

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;

const log = func = (...args) => {
  console.log(...args);             // 3
  console.log(args.length);         // 1
  return args;
};

const result = log((add(1,2)));
console.log(result);                // [ 3 ]
```

This concept is pretty important to understand because in the React world, a common pattern is to use **Higher-order Components (HoC)**, treating our components as functions, and enhancing them with common behaviours.
