# Children
JSX allowes you to define childeren to describe the tree of elements and compose complex user-interfaces. 

A link can be enclosed inside a `div` for some layout requirements, and JSX snippet to achieve that is as follows: 

> ./node_modules/.bin/babel --plugins transform-react-jsx ch.02/07.jsx.js  -o ch.02/08.javascript.js

JSX
```html
var image = <div>
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">Click me!</a>
</div>;
```
JavaScript
```javascript
"use strict";

var image = React.createElement(
    "div",
    null,
    React.createElement(
        "a",
        { href: "https://facebook.github.io/react/" },
        "Click me!"
    )
);
```

The good part is that we are not limited to having elements as children of elements, but we can use JavaScript expressions such as function or variables.
