# Loop

A very common operation in user-interface development is to display lists of items. 

We can use any JavaScript expression inside curly braces and the most common way to generate an array of elements. given an array of objects, is to use `map`. 

```javascript
<ul>
    { users.map( user => <li>{user.name}</li> ) }
</ul>
```
