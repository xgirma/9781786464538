# JavaScript templating
The advantage of moving the `template` inside our component instead of using external template library is that `we can 
use the power of JavaScript`.

The Spread attributes is an example of that, and another common example is that JavaScript expression can be used as 
attributes values by enclosing them within curly braces.

```html
<button disabled={errors.length} />
```
