# Control statements
Conditional and loops are very common operations in user-interface templates.
 
In general, we aim to remove all the logic from our components, and especially from our render methods, but sometimes we have to show and hide elements according to the state of the application, and very often we have to loop through collections and arrays. 

If you feel that using JSX for that kind of operation will make your code more readable, there is a Babel plugin available to do just that: `jsx-control-statements'. 

```javascript
<If condition={this.canShowSecretData}> <SecretData /> </If>
````

This gets transpiled into a ternary expression as follows:

```html
{ canShowSecretData ? <SecretData /> : null }
``` 

The `If` component is great, but it for some reason you have nested conditions in your render method, it can easily become messy and hard to follow. Here is where the `Choose` component comes in handy: 

JSX
```javascript
function Selection(props) {
    return (
        <Choose>
            <When condition={props.first}>
                <span>if</span>
            </When>
            <When condition={props.second}>
                <span>else if</span>
            </When>
            <Otherwise>
                <span>else</span>
            </Otherwise>
        </Choose>
    )
}
```

JavaScript:
```javascript
"use strict";

function Selection(props) {
    return React.createElement(
        Choose,
        null,
        React.createElement(
            When,
            { condition: props.first },
            React.createElement(
                "span",
                null,
                "if"
            )
        ),
        React.createElement(
            When,
            { condition: props.second },
            React.createElement(
                "span",
                null,
                "else if"
            )
        ),
        React.createElement(
            Otherwise,
            null,
            React.createElement(
                "span",
                null,
                "else"
            )
        )
    );
}
```
