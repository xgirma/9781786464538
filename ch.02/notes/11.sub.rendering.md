# Sub-rendering
Keep our component very small and our render method very clean and simple. 

When a render method becomes too long to maintain, split it into smaller ones. 

````javascript
class Menu extends Component () {
  renderUserMenu () {
    // JSX for user menu
  }

  renderAdminMenu () {
    // JSX for admin menu
  }

  render () {
    <div>
      {this.userExists && this.renderUserMenu()}
      {this.userIsAdmin && this.renderAdminMenu()}
    </div>
  }
}
````

This is not always considered a best practice because it seems more obvious to split the component into smaller ones.
