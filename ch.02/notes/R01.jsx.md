# JSX        

A simple JSX. 

```javascript
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
    render () {
        return <div> Hello {this.props.name} </div>
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloMessage name="Girma" />, mountNode);
```

## DOM elements and React components
With JSX, we can create both HTML elements and React components, `the only difference is whether or not they start with a capital letter`. 

For example, to render an HTML button, we use `<button />`, while to render our Button components we use `<Button />`. 

The first button transpiled into the following 

```javascript
React.createElement('button')
```

The second one is transpiled into the following
```javascript
React.createElement(Button)
```
The difference here is that in the first call we are passing the type of the DOM element as a string, while in the second call we are passing the component itself, which means that it should exist in the scope to work.
