# Differences with HTML
Differences between JSX and HTML
## Attributes
JSX is not a standard language and it gets transpiled into JavaScript. Because of this, some attributes cannot be used. For example, instead of `class` we have to use `className`, and instead of `for`, we have to use `htmlFor`

```html
<label className="shot-label" htmlFor="name" />
```

## Style
The `style` attribute does not accept a CSS string as the HTML parallel does, but it expects a JavaScript object where the style names are `camelCased`.

```javascript
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
```

## Root
JSX elements get translated into JavaScript functions and you cannot return two functions in JavaScript, whenever you have multiple elements at the same level, you are foced to wrap them into a parent. 

The following:
````html
<div />
<div />
````
This gives us the following error:
> Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosed tag

On the other hand, the following works:
```html
<div>
    <div />
    <div />
</div>
```
## Spaces
JSX handles the spaces between text and elements differently from HTML. 

Consider the following snippet: 
```html
<div>
    <span>foo</span>
    bar
    <span>baz</span>
</div>
```

In the browser, which interprets HTML, this could give you `foo bar baz`, which is exactly what we expect. In JSX, instead, the same code would be rendered as `foobarbaz`, which is because the three nested lines get transpiled as individual children of the `div` element, without taking the `spaces` into account. A common solution to get the same output, is putting a space explicitly between the element: 

```html
<div>
    <span>foo</span>
    {' '}
    bar
    {' '}
    <span>baz</span>
</div>
```

## Boolean attributes
In JSX, if you set an attribute without value, JSX assumes that its value is true, following the same behavior of the HTML `disabled attribute`, for example. 

This means that if we want to set an attribute to false, we have to declare it explicitly as false: 

```javascript
<button disabled />
React.createElement("button", { disabled: true });
```
More example
```javascript
<button disabled={ false } />
React.createElement("button", { disabled: false });
```
