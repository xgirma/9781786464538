# Purity
An important aspects of FP is to write pure function. 

A function is pure when there are no `sideeffects`, which means that the function `does not change anything that is not local` to the functions itself. 

For example a function that modify variables defined in the outer scope or touches external entities considered `impure`. 

Impure functions are harder to debug and most of the time it is not possible to apply them multiple times and expect to get the same result. 

```javascript
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y; // pure
```

It can be run multiple times, always getting the same result, because nothing is stored anywhere and nothing gets modified. 

```javascript
let x = 0;
const add = y => (x = x + y);  // impure
```

Impure, because running `add(1)` twice, we get two different results.
