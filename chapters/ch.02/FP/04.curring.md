# Curring
A common technique in FP is curring. **Currying** is the process of `converting` a function 

> 1. that takes `multiple arguments` 
> 2. into a function that takes `one argument at a time`, 
> 3. returning another `function`.

Instead of:

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y
```

We define the function like this

```javascript
// const add = ( x, y) => x + y

const add = x => y => x + y;

const sum = add(1);
const x = sum(2);   // 3
console.log(x);
const y = sum(3);
console.log(y);     // 4
```

This is a pretty convenient way of writting functions because since `the first value is stored` after the application of the first parameter, we can `reuse the second function multiple times`.
