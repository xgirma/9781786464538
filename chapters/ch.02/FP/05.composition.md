# Composition
An important concept in FP that can be applied to react is composition. Functions (and components) can be combined to produce new functions with more advanced features and props. 

add and square
```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const square = x => x * x;

const addAndSquare = (x, y) => square(add(x,y));

console.log(addAndSquare(2,3)); // 25
```
