## FP and User Interfaces

How we can use FP to build user-interfaces, which is what we use React for.

> We can think of about a `user-interface` as a function to which is applied the `state` of the application, as follows

        user-interface = f(state)
        
We expect this function to be idempotent, so that it returns `the same user-interface` given the `same state` of the application. 


> `Idempotent` (adj.) denoting an element of a set that is unchanged in value when multiplied or otherwise operated on by itself.
